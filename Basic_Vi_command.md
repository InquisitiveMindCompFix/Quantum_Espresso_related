Hereâ€™s a list of **basic `vi` (or `vim`) commands** to help you navigate and edit files in the `vi` text editor, a powerful but sometimes intimidating tool for beginners:

---

### **Starting and Exiting**
- Open a file:  
  ```bash
  vi filename
  ```
- Save and exit:  
  ```vim
  :wq  # Write (save) and quit
  ```
- Quit without saving:  
  ```vim
  :q!  # Force quit (discard changes)
  ```
- Save without exiting:  
  ```vim
  :w   # Write (save) changes
  ```

### **Modes in `vi`**
1. **Command Mode** (default mode when you open `vi`):  
   - Navigate, delete, copy, paste, search, etc.  
   - Press `Esc` to return to Command Mode from other modes.  

2. **Insert Mode** (to edit text):  
   - Press `i` to start inserting text at the cursor.  
   - Other insert commands:  
     - `a` â€“ Insert **after** the cursor.  
     - `o` â€“ Insert a new line **below** the current line.  
     - `O` â€“ Insert a new line **above** the current line.

### **Editing (Command Mode)**

### **Visual Mode**

### **Helpful Tips**
- Show line numbers:  
  ```vim

  ```

**Practice Tip:** Open a test file (e.g., `vi test.txt`) and experiment with these commands. Remember, `vi` mastery takes timeâ€”start with basic navigation and editing! ðŸ˜Š
