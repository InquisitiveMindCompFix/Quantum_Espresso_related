This tutorial covers the basic 2D plotting techniques using XMGRACE.

XMGRACE requires an input file, which can contain several coloumns.

EXERCISE 1 :

	The data file Example00.dat contains the data of
	(a). 'Lattice Constant (Angstroms)' of metal X in coloumn1,
	(b). 'Total Energy (Ry)' of metal X in Coloumn 2.

	Ploting
	Follow the commands to open the xmgrace
		--$ xmgrace
		-- Go to Data/Import/ASCII/Example00.dat
		-- load as Single Set.
	Label both x and y axis.
		-- Go to Plot/SetAppearence or Double click on the particular axis. Change the axis lables and scale.
	Incorporate the legendes in the plot.
		-- Go to Plot/SetAppearance or Double click on the body of the plot. Write the legends in the Legends/Sstrcing
	Change the lines atyles and symbol types.
		-- Plot/SetAppearance or Double click on the body of the plot.


Exercise 2 : 
	
	The data file Example01.dat contains data for
	(a). 'Lattice Constant (Angstrom)' of metal X in Coloumn1,
	(b). 'Pressure' in Coloumn2,
	(c). The error in the total energy in Coloumn3.

	Plot to see how Pressure varies with the lattice constant with the error bars.
		--$ xmgrace
		-- Go to Data/Import/ASCII/Example01.dat
		-- Load as Block Data.
		-- Choose 1st and 2nd coloumns of the file.
		-- Choose Set Type: XY
		-- X from coloumn 1
		-- Y from coloumn 2
	

	Assuming the 3rd column contains the error in the data in the 2nd column, plot 1st and 2nd columns of the file with the error bars.
		-- Choose Set Type:XYDY
		-- X from coloumn 1
		-- Y from coloumn 2
		-- DY (Y1) from coloumn 3
		-- Label x and y axis, incorporate legends, change the line style and symbol types.
